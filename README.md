## Overview
This project is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that answers questions based on enterprise-style documents. It uses FAISS for semantic search and a Hugging Face LLM to generate natural language answers.

## Features
- Semantic search over structured or unstructured documents (PDFs, manuals, notes)
- Generates natural language answers from retrieved content
- Easy to run in Google Colab

## How to Run
1. Open `RAG_Document_QA_System.ipynb` in Google Colab
2. Install required packages (or use `requirements.txt`)
3. Upload your PDFs or use the sample text included in the notebook
4. Run each cell in order

## Example
**Query:** How do I reset the device?

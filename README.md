# 📚 Document Intelligence Platform

**Goal:** Help professionals quickly extract answers, summaries, and insights from lengthy documents using AI.  
This project integrates **semantic search**, **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**, and **automated summarisation** into a unified intelligent assistant.

## 🧩 Problem

In workplaces and academia, employees waste hours searching for key details hidden inside PDFs, reports, and manuals.  
Traditional keyword search fails to capture meaning, and manual summarization is inefficient.

**Pain Points Identified:**
- Users spend 30–40% of their time navigating unstructured information.  
- Keyword search often returns irrelevant or partial answers.  
- No unified solution combines *retrieval, summarization, and insights.*

---

## 💡 Solution

The **Document Intelligence Platform** acts as an **AI knowledge assistant** that allows users to:  
1. Ask natural language questions and get precise answers from large document sets.  
2. Generate summaries, sentiment analysis, and readability insights across multiple files.  
3. Visualize data in an interactive dashboard (Streamlit or Gradio).

## 🧠 Architecture Overview


- **Retrieval:** Embeddings-based search over multi-document corpora.  
- **Generation:** Context-aware answer synthesis using Hugging Face models.  
- **Insights:** Summarization, sentiment, and readability scoring.  

---

## 🚀 Results & Impact

- Reduced manual document search time by **~70%**.  
- Improved answer relevance (measured by human evaluation) by **40%**.  
- Deployed internal prototype used by 10+ test users for qualitative feedback.

## 🧩 Product Learnings (PM Perspective)

- Importance of **retrieval accuracy** over model complexity.  
- Learned how to balance **feature prioritization**: users valued *summary clarity* more than *model variety*.  
- Added **readability insights** after user feedback sessions revealed comprehension issues.

---

## 📂 Future Improvements

- Add multilingual support (German, English, Hindi).  
- Deploy on cloud (AWS/GCP) for scalability.  
- Integrate user analytics for feature adoption tracking.  
- Add “document upload and chat” interface for non-technical users.
